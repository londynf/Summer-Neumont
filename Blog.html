<h2>Summer Neumont WebDev Class</h2>
<h3>July 2, 2019</h3>
<article>I decided to take the Summer Scholars Intro to Web Development class. It is a 5-week course 
    with other seniors from the area and my teacher, Tim Clark. I have learned HTML and CSS so far. 
    In the next couple weeks I will learn and apply JavaScript to what I have already created (hint, 
    this webpage). <br>I take front runner in from Farmington, then Trax to Neumont, on Mondays and 
    Wednesdays for class. Class goes from 1-3:15 where the first 1 1/2 hours is a lecture then the 
    rest is saved for project work time. <br>One of the missions of this course is to create a fully-functioning
    webpage for our own purposes that is interactive and well-coded. I have decided to base mine
    off of a blog page created from scratch. It has been a little more difficult than I originally thought
    it would be but I have learned a lot and I'm happy about what I can do with my knowledge so far. To master
    the basics of the code we have learned so far, we use <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn" target="_blank">Codecademy</a> and complete their lessons.
    I am impressed with how much I am able to learn from this website because instead of a bunch of reading
    it is interactive so I am using the newly-learned code in real time and for real-life projects. However, 
    the lessons are long (I just completed CSS which was approx. 11 hours). <br>Because Summer Scholars is such a short
    course, we are cramming and so I had only a week to complete this lesson before we moved on JavaScript. While I 
    am not penalized for late work, I am not a procrastinator and refuse to get behind. This meant that I sat for 
    a minimum of 2 hours a day, every day, watching the Fifa Women's World Cup on my couch and binging
    the CSS Codecademy lesson. To say the least, I wasn't impressed about it. <br>I also do other summer school courses
    which are a lot of time and work so I wasn't happy about the time I had to dedicate to this assignment. <br>Last friday, June 28, was a particularly
    hard day for me and school because I was spending so much time and the amount of assignments I was completing was not
    showing. I probably spent 3-4 hours on school work from Neumont and my online classes and I'd turned in two assignments. 
    I was pretty upset about it. After coming home from taking a break and going to a softball game for a good friend,
    I come home to find a surprise in my room. My favorite snacks neatly set up on my bed from a friend who wanted to
    make my day better realizing my stress. What a blessing the surprise and my friend are!  <br>
