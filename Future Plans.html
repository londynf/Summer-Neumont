<h1>Future Plans</h1>
<p>Bro, I don't even know what I'm having for dinner, you expect me to have a plan for what I want to do with my life??</p>   
<p>But if we are gonna be <em>technical</em>, I'm interested in entering the health science pathway, medical field. So I'll probably go to colege. I have considered military, physical therapy, personal trainer, surgeon.</p>
<p>Getting married sounds swell and I'm sure kids wouldn't be the worst....probably. :)</p>
