    <p>Well hello there! My name is Londyn Fletcher. I'm the oldest kid in my family, and definitely the coolest. I go to Farmington HS. I play and ref soccer as well as run with XC. I'm pretty cool; I have no life and spend my days working out and cleaning my room. -HMU! :) </p>
    <p>One of my favorite scriptures is D+C 18:10 <em><q>Remember the worth of souls is great in the sight of God.</q></em></p>
